# User Stories for TaskFlow

This is a backlog of user stories for TaskFlow, a simple task management tool designed for individuals and small teams to organize tasks, set priorities, and track progress. These user stories provide a structured example of current and potential features.

## Current Features

These are features that are currently implemented in TaskFlow and are highlighted on the landing page.

### Illustrated Features

1. As a user, I want to create tasks with due dates, so I can track deadlines and stay organized.
2. As a user, I want to categorize tasks into different lists (e.g., Work, Personal, Errands), so I can keep my tasks structured.
3. As a team member, I want to assign tasks to specific users, so I can delegate work effectively.

### Other Features

1. As a user, I want to set task priorities (Low, Medium, High), so I can focus on the most important tasks first.
2. As a team manager, I want to view a shared team task board, so I can see everyone’s progress at a glance.
3. As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete, so I can track what I have accomplished.
4. As a system administrator, I want user accounts to be secured with two-factor authentication, so I can protect sensitive data.

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As a user, I want to set recurring tasks, so I don’t have to manually create them every time.
2. As a team manager, I want to add comments to tasks, so team members can discuss details within the app.
3. As a user, I want to receive notifications when a task is due soon, so I don’t miss important deadlines.
4. As a user, I want to create subtasks under a main task, so I can break large tasks into smaller steps.
5. As a team leader, I want to generate a summary report of completed tasks each week, so I can review team productivity.
6. As a user, I want to customize the color and layout of my task lists, so I can organize my workspace to my preference.
7. As a user, I want to export my tasks as a CSV file, so I can back up or analyze my data externally.
8. As a user, I want to enable offline mode for task creation and editing, so I can continue working without internet access.
9. As a developer, I want a REST API endpoint to create tasks, so external apps can integrate with TaskFlow.
10. As a developer, I want a webhook for completed tasks, so external systems can receive updates when a task is marked as done.
11. As a user, I want to sync my task deadlines with Google Calendar, so I can view my due dates in my daily schedule.
12. As a user, I want my offline tasks to sync automatically when I reconnect, so I don’t lose progress.
13. As a system administrator, I want to set role-based access controls, so I can manage different permission levels for users.
